Common Stroke Medications Guide
________________________________________
1. Antiplatelet Agents (Prevent Blood Clots)
•	Aspirin
o	Dosage: 75–100 mg
o	Frequency: Once daily
o	Purpose: Prevents stroke caused by blood clots by thinning the blood and stopping platelets from clumping together.
•	Clopidogrel
o	Dosage: 75 mg
o	Frequency: Once daily
o	Purpose: Alternative to aspirin or can be combined with aspirin for high-risk stroke cases for up to 90 days.
o	✅ CYP2C19 Test:
	A genetic test determines if clopidogrel will work effectively for you. Some people cannot process it properly due to their genetics, making it less effective in preventing strokes.
	Ask your doctor if this test is necessary.
•	Ticagrelor
o	Dosage: 90 mg
o	Frequency: Twice daily
o	Purpose: Another alternative to clopidogrel or combined with aspirin for high-risk cases for up to 90 days.
o	✅ CYP2C19 Test:
	Similar to clopidogrel, a CYP2C19 test may be necessary to determine how your body responds to these medications.

2. Anticoagulants (Prevent Blood Clots)
•	Warfarin
o	Dosage: 2–10 mg (adjusted based on INR levels)
o	Frequency: Once daily
o	Purpose: Prevents strokes by thinning the blood and reducing clot formation, especially for conditions like irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation).
o	✅ INR Test (for Warfarin Users):
	INR (International Normalized Ratio) measures how long it takes your blood to clot.
	Target INR: 2 to 3 for stroke prevention.
	INR levels should stay in range at least 70% of the time for effective stroke prevention.
	Regular blood tests are needed to adjust your dose safely.
•	Dabigatran
o	Dosage: 150 mg
o	Frequency: Twice daily
o	Purpose: Prevents strokes related to atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat).
o	✅ Note: No regular blood tests required compared to warfarin.
•	Rivaroxaban
o	Dosage: 20 mg
o	Frequency: Once daily (preferably with food)
o	Purpose: Alternative to warfarin for stroke prevention, particularly in atrial fibrillation cases.
•	Apixaban
o	Dosage: 5 mg twice daily
o	Purpose: Prevents strokes in atrial fibrillation patients by thinning the blood.
o	✅ Kidney & Age Considerations:
	A lower dose of 2.5 mg twice daily may be required if two of these conditions are present:
	Creatinine >133 mmol/L (reduced kidney function)
	Age >80 years
	Body weight <65 kg

3. Blood Pressure Medications (Control Hypertension)
ACE Inhibitors (Reduce blood vessel narrowing):
•	Enalapril: 5–20 mg once or twice daily
•	Ramipril: 2.5–10 mg once daily
•	Perindopril: 4–8 mg once daily
Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) (Prevent blood vessel tightening):
•	Telmisartan: 40–80 mg once daily
•	Losartan: 50–100 mg once daily
•	Irbesartan: 150–300 mg once daily
•	Valsartan: 80–160 mg once daily
Calcium Channel Blocker (Relaxes blood vessels):
•	Amlodipine: 5–10 mg once daily
Beta-Blockers (Slows heart rate and reduces blood pressure):
•	Metoprolol: 50–100 mg twice daily
•	Bisoprolol: 2.5–10 mg once daily
•	Nebivolol: 2.5–10 mg once daily
Diuretics (Help remove excess fluid and lower blood pressure):
•	Spironolactone: 12.5–50 mg once daily
•	Hydrochlorothiazide: 12.5–25 mg once daily
✅ Kidney & Age Considerations:
•	Older adults or those with kidney issues may need lower doses for safety. Always consult your doctor for proper dosing adjustments.

4. Statins (Cholesterol Management)
•	Atorvastatin
o	Dosage: 10–80 mg
o	Frequency: Once daily
•	Rosuvastatin
o	Dosage: 5–20 mg
o	Frequency: Once daily
•	Simvastatin
o	Dosage: 10–40 mg
o	Frequency: Once daily at night
✅ Cholesterol Management:
•	Statins lower LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol) and triglycerides, reducing stroke risk.
•	Discuss your LDL cholesterol and triglyceride targets with your doctor.
•	High-risk patients should aim for an LDL below 1.8 mmol/L for optimal stroke prevention.

✅ Key Takeaways
•	CYP2C19 Test: A genetic test can help determine if clopidogrel will work effectively for you.
•	INR Test (for Warfarin Users): A blood test to monitor your blood's clotting ability. Staying within the 2-3 range at least 70% of the time is crucial for preventing strokes.
•	Kidney & Age Considerations: If you are over 80 years old, underweight, or have kidney problems, lower medication doses may be required. Consult your doctor.
•	Cholesterol Management: Aim for low LDL cholesterol and triglycerides to reduce stroke risk. High-risk patients should keep LDL under 1.8 mmol/L.
